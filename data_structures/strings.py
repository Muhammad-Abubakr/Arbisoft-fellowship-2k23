Strings:
a) Are strings mutable or immutable in Python?

b) How do you concatenate two strings in Python?

c) What does the split() method do for strings?

Great job on answering the string questions! You nailed it! Your answers are spot on:

a) Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after they 
    are created. If you want to modify a string, you'll create a new string with the desired changes.

b) Concatenating two strings in Python is commonly done using the `+` operator. 
    For example, `"Hello" + " " + "World"` results in the string `"Hello World"`.

c) The `split()` method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings 
    based on a given delimiter. By default, the delimiter is a space, but you can 
    specify a different delimiter as an argument to the `split()` method.

You've demonstrated a good understanding of strings in Python! If you're ready for more
questions or have any other topics you'd like to explore, feel free to let me know. 
Keep up the great work!
