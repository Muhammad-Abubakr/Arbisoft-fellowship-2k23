"""
You are absolutely correct in your answers! Well done!

a) The main difference between tuples and lists in Python is that 
    tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified or 
    changed after the tuple is created. On the other hand, lists are 
    mutable, allowing you to add, remove, or modify elements dynamically.
    Additionally, lists are dynamically sized, meaning they can grow or
    shrink in size as needed, whereas tuples have a fixed size once they 
    are created.

b) You are absolutely right! Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot
    be modified or changed. This immutability property ensures that the content
    of the tuple remains constant throughout its lifetime.

Your understanding of tuples in Python is excellent! If you have any more questions
or want to explore other topics, feel free to ask. Keep up the great work! ðŸ˜Š
